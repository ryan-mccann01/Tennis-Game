Pong based tennis game
  For our tennis game, we were able to create first a basic pong like game, with working bounce mechanics aswell as collison detection. The ball would strike the paddle and bounce to the opposite wall, and then bounce back twoarsds the paddle.  Then we worked out a scoring system, aswell as the sscreen flashing "game over" if the ball was missed by the player.  Finally, wee added cosmestic changes to make the background look more like a tennis court, and the ball and raquet to apper more realistic than we previously had them.  Initally, we hoped to add sound effetcs into the game, but were unable to do this successfully. Both me and nate worked through each part of the code together, and both worked toghether to solve any problems that arose.
